Make sure that both your Keenetic devices are now connected to a power source. Check that the <b>Status LED</b> {{statusLed}} on the ‘Extender’ is illuminated and not blinking.<br><br>3. Reconnect this mobile device / computer to your Keenetic Main Router network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable to add an extender candidate to your Wi-Fi System.<br><br>4. Log in to the Main Router and open Wi-Fi System section. Find the extender candidate in the list, and click the <b>Acquire</b> button next to it.<br><br>5. A Keenetic Wi-Fi System will support both wireless and wired connections between the Main Router and Extenders to maximize network throughput and stability. After setup is complete, disconnect your Extender from the Main Router and place the Extender where you want to expand your Wi-Fi network in your home or small office."
